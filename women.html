    <h2>Empowering Women in the Society</h2><br>
    <p style="color:brown">
        Women's well-being depends on their empowerment social, cultural, political and economical. The Government of Kerala has adopted various strategies to enhance the status of women and empower them to address the negative social and economic impacts. 
Because women empowerment will lead to an improvement of the socio-economic conditions of the society in a number of ways. The women empowerment programmes of the Department of Social Justice cover welfare and support services, training for employment and income generation, 
awareness generation and gender sensitization. All these efforts are directed to ensure that women are empowered both economically, socially and thus became equal partners in the development of the state along with men.
Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Policy.The State Government has approved a Gender Equality and Women Empowerment Policy as per G.O.(M.S) 27/2015/SJD dated 16-04-2015. This policy aims to lay a basis for the harmonious co-existence of both sexes.
 It aims to do so within a framework of mutual respect, for the equal access of women and men to economic, social and political opportunities, resources, and benefits; and for a society where both women and men can participate in and benefit as equal partners in the development process of their communities, the State and the Country.

    <h2>Domestic Violence Prohibition</h2>
    <p>Over the last two decades, domestic violence has emerged as one of the most serious problem faced by women in Kerala. They are experiencing physical and psychological violence not only from their in-laws but also often from their intimate partner.
        This scenario, underlines the need for the effective implementation of Domestic Violence Act 2005, which came into force in October 2006. The definition of DV has been made wide enough to encompass every possibility of abuse/harm to the woman. It has been welcomed by all since it provides for the first time civil remedies to women by way of protection orders, residence orders and orders for monetary relief in the event of a domestic violence incident.
        The Act is basically meant to provide protection to the wife or female live in partner from violence at the hands of the husband of male live-in-partner or his relatives. Domestic violence under the Act includes actual abuse or the threat of abuse, whether physical sexual, verbal emotional or economic. Harassment by way of unlawful dowry demands to the women victim, or her relatives would also be covered under the definition of domestic violence.

<div class="hsg" id="dbsb">
    <h2>Dowry Prohibition</h2>
    <p>The Dowry system in India refers to the durable goods, cash, and real or movable property that the bride's 
        family gives to the bridegroom, his parents, or his relatives as a condition of the marriage. ‘Dowry’ means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage; or by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person, to either party to the marriage or to any other person; at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of said parties but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) applies. In July 2004, the State Government amended the Kerala Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961 by superseding the Kerala Dowry Prohibition Rules 1992. 
        The amended Act incorporated same of the longstanding demands of the National Women’s Commission.</p>

    <h2>Nirbhaya</h2>
    <p>
        Kerala which has the distinction of havng achieved the highest levels of female literacy, education and health and the lowerst maternal and child mortality rates in India, as well as an enviable male-female ratio is also the state which is facing severe challenges in social arena. 

Despite their high level of education including univeristy education, the visibility of women in the political, cultural, literacy and social fields is negligible. This is also a state which has a high level of reported cases of suicides and mental depression and very low female work participation rates. Distorted notions of male-female relationships find expression in violence against women in the form of molestation, rape and other forms of abuse raising disturbing questions about safety of women and children that society as a whole, both men and women, need to address.

In the recent years, sex trafficking in Kerala has assumed different forms at various levels-local, inter district, inter state and even cross-border as well as in homes, at a scale that raises significant social concerns. The occurences of instances of sexual violence and sex trafficking creates a situation that questions the safety of women and children in both public and private domain. Sexual violence against women and children is deep rooted in the patriarchal perception of power which is prevalent across the globe. Sex trafficking of women and children is a multi-dimensional problem encompassing a whole range of economic, educational, social, developmental and cultural issues, which are varied and highly complex.

Human trafficking is the third largest organized crime in the world and is defined by United Nations as "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons by menas of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a persons having control over another persons, for the purpose of exploitation".

To combat child abuse, sexual violence and sex trafficking, three main areas of interventon will be required:- 

Prevention- By addressing the root causes of this problem including empowerment of vulnerable groups, targeting contributing factors such as gender discrimination, alchoholism, consumerism etc. and preparing communities to be vigilant and thwart any attempts to commit the crime.

Protection-By initiating strong corrective and remedial measures and providing an enabling environment in the form of protection services for the victims to heal, recover, empower and reintegrate back to the society.

Prosecution- By ensuring a strong rule of law which will be a deterant for such crimes to recur. </p>

    <h2>Safe Workplace (POSH Act)</h2>
    <p>
        A safe workplace is a woman's legal right. Sexual harrassment constitues a gross violation of women's right to equality and dignity. It has its roots in patriarchy and its attendant perception that men are superior to women and that some forms of violence against women are acceptable.

        One of these is workplace sexual harassment which is understood as a violation of women's rights and a form of violence against women. Workplace sexual harrassment, like other forms of violence, is not harmless. 
        
        The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition ad Redressal) Act 2013 was enacted to ensure safe working spaces for women and to build enabling work environments that respect women's right to equality of status and opportunity. An effective implementation of the Act will contribute to the relaization of their right to gender equality, life and liberty, equality in working conditions
        everywhere. 
        
        The sense of security at the workplace will improve women's participation in work, resulting in their economic empowerment and inclusive growth. Today all workplaces in India are mandated by law to provide a safe and secure working environment free from sexual harassment for all women. 
        
        Sexual harassment includes anyone or more of the following unwelcome acts or behaviour (whether directly or by implication), namely:-
        
        physical contact advances;
        
        a demand or request for sexual favours;
        
        making sexually coloured remarks;
        
        showing pronography;
        
        any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.
        
        Prevention and Prohibition
        
        An employer refers to:
        1. The head of the department, organisation, undertaking, establishment, enterprise, institution, office, branch or unit of the Appropriate Government or local authority or such officer specified in this behalf.
        2. Any person (whether contractual or not) responsible for the management, supervision and control of a designated workplace not covered under clause (i).
        3. A person or a household who employs or benefits from the employment of domestic worker or women employees.
        
        Complaints Committees
        
        The Act provides for two kinds of complaints mechanisms: Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) and Local Complaints Committee (LCC).
